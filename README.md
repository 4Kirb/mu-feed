# mu-feed
A MangaUpdates RSS feed generator

You can self-host this on [now.sh](https://now.sh) with very little knowledge and use this to generate RSS feeds for [MangaUpdates](https://www.mangaupdates.com/)

## Setup

To use it, you should make their list public.

The settings I use on my reading list are below:

You will then be able to see your public list URL, for example, mine is: 

`https://www.mangaupdates.com/mylist.html?id=542166&list=read`

Take note of the `?id=xxxx&list=xxxx` part for later

## Instructions

Go to import a repository, as seen below:
